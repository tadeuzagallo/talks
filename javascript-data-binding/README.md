# Talk Model

This is just a model that I use to create my talks

## It uses 

* reveal.js
* gulp
* haml
* sass
* coffee-script
* livereload

And loads of other stuff on the build like jshint, coffeelint....

--- 

I just made it as flexible as I needed (within the time that I had),
but feel free to fork and adjust if you think it might help you
